# Stack
## Tracking the execution of function calls
### Table example

line | Code | Console Output
-----|------|---------------
1|`public void Main()`|
2|`{`
3|`int result = AddNumbers(5, 10);`|"Executing AddNumbers function with arguments: 5 and 10"
4|`Console.WriteLine($"Result of adding 5 and 10 is: {result}");`|"Result of adding 5 and 10 is: 15"
5|`}`
6|
7|`public int AddNumbers(int num1, int num2)`
8|`{`
9|`Console.WriteLine($"Executing AddNumbers function with arguments: {num1} and {num2}");`
10|`int sum = num1 + num2;`
11|`Console.WriteLine($"Returning sum of {num1} and {num2}: {sum}");`|"Returning sum of 5 and 10: 15"
12|`return sum;`
13|`}`

In this table, the left-hand column represents the line numbers in the code, while the middle column shows the code that's being executed on each line. The right-hand column shows the console output that's generated when each line is executed. Note that some lines in the code don't generate any console output, so those cells in the table are left blank.



# Set explain in a table form

Operation | Explanation | C# Example
----------|-------------|---------------
`Add()`|The operation help us add element to the set using the `Add()` method| mySet.Add("car");
`Remove()`| We remove the element "car" from the set using the `Remove()` method.| mySet.Remove("car")
`Contains()`|In C#, you can test whether an element is a member of a set using the `Contains()`|mySet.Contains("car")
`Count`|We can find the number of elements in the set using the `Count` property and assign the result to an integer variable `count`. Finally, we print the value of `count` to the console.|int count = mySet.Count()
`Union`, `intersect`, `Except`| In set data structure, the union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the two sets. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. The difference of two sets is the set of all elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.| set1.Union(set2), set1.Intersect(set2), set1.Except(set2)
