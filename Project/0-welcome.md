# Data Structure Tutorial
## Welcome to our data structure tutorial
## Brief Introduction
A brief introduction to data structure and what we will be learning in this tutorial before we start proper. Below are a link that will connect us to the different topics that will be discussed in this tutorial. 
Data structure is a structure of programming that arranges, sort, implement, create, manipulate, and order data in various format for proper use and readability. Every implementation uses different data structure method to provide desirable result or outcome base on what is needed to be achieve, and the required time taken and space needed to achieve it. So in this case our focus will be base on three data structure, which are stack, set, and tree. The three links below takes us to a well detailed page that explains each one of them using the C# coding language to write programs on how to implement that structure.
