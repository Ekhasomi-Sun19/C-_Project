## Introduction

Understanding the stack data structure 

```csharp
The purpose of a stack data structure is to store and manage the collection of element in Last In First Out Data structure LIFO. This means that the most recently added element is always the first one to be removed. 
```
## What is the purpose of the data structure?
The two basic operations that can be perform with stacks are 
[Push](https://afteracademy.com/blog/stack-and-its-basic-operations/#:~:text=Push%20operation%20refers%20to%20inserting,the%20top%20of%20the%20stack.) and [Pop](https://afteracademy.com/blog/stack-and-its-basic-operations/#:~:text=Push%20operation%20refers%20to%20inserting,the%20top%20of%20the%20stack.). The stack data structure is useful in many programming scenarios, such as parsing expressions, tracking the execution of function calls, undo/redo operations in text editors.
```charp
```
## What is the performance of the data structure 
```csharp
Explain big O notation


```

## Efficiency of common operations

```csharp



```

## Examples
```csharp



```

## Problem to Solve
```csharp
Give and explain possible problem to be solve


```
## How would the data structure be used in C#
```charp
discuss recursion in this section of your outline


```
## Explain what kind of error are common using this data structure.
```csharp



```
